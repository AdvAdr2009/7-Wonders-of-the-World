<h1><center><u>The Great Wall of China</u></center></h1>
<p>For centuries, China's greatest threat came from the north, where warlike tribes mounted swift, fierce raids on unprotected settlements.To keep them out, the Chinese emperors built a series of walls stretching thousands of kilometres. It extends to 21,196 km. There were many people who died during the construction and their bodies were buried near the wall itself.</p>
<p>The construction of the wall was started by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in 221 BCE. The construction of the wall was ended by the Qing Dynasty in 1878 CE. The construction of the wall took over 2000 years. It was the largest man-made structure in the world. The most important parts of the walls were built by the Ming Dynasty.</p>
