<h1><center><u>The Taj Mahal, Agra</u></center></h1>
<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white mausoleum completely made of marble situated in Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by Shah Jahan for the tomb of his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan. The tomb is a center piece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal was designated as an UNESCO heritage site in 1983 for being "the jewel of muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts over 7-8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.</p>
<p>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin. The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.</p>
