<h1>The Colosseum in Rome</h1>
<p>The colosseum was a huge arena which was the site of elaborate public shows called circuses. They included acrobats, wild beast fights, public executions, and battles between professional warriors called gladiators.</p>
<p>The colosseum has a retractable shade which consists of a huge awning which could be extended to protect spectators from the heat of the sun. A special group of sailors from the Roman navy were assigned to operate the awning ropes and masts. There were huge crowds of thousands. The circuses were paid for by the emperor as a gift to the people and huge crowds attended. The outside of the colosseum was decorated with statues of generals and politicians. The spectators entered throught the 80 archways spaced around the outside. The gladiators entered through the two gladiator gateways at the north and the south.Supplies were brought in throught the underground passages. The colosseum could hold over 50,000 spectators.</p>
<p>The seating levels in the Colosseum mirrored the social classes in the Roman Empire. The slaves would sit the most furthest back. Then the foregners would sit in front of them. Then comes the plebians who are workers and labourers. Then are the aristocrats in the empire in front of the workers. The politicians of the empie would sit in front of them. Then comes the emperor and empress and his guests who were heavily guarded and had their own box. A defeated gladiator's fate would be decided by the emperor who would say wheather the opponent should kill him or give him mercy.</p>
