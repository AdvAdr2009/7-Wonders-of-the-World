<h1><center><u>Petra in Jordan</u></center></h1>
<p>Inhabited for thousands of years, the strikingly beautiful desert city of Petra, Jordan was once home to a civilization long since vanished. Petra's location between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea made it an important center for commerce, where Arabian incense, Chinese silks, and Indian spices were traded. The buildings reflect a welcoming of cultures, combining native Eastern traditions with Western Classical (850 BC-476 AD) architecture from Hellenistic Greece. Noted by UNESCO as "half-built, half-carved into the rock," this capital city also had a sophisticated system of dams and channels for collecting, diverting, and providing water to the arid region.</p>
